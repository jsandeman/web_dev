        <h2>What</h2>

        <p>Research has shown that physician burnout is a significant problem that is getting worse.
            There are many reasons for this, including patient load, ever more guidelines, increased
            complexity of billing and reimbursement, and the complexities and challenges of Electronic
            Health Record Systems (EHRs). There is evidence to support what the author has
            recognized from eight years in family medicine practice: EHRs often make simple tasks, like
            ordering an x-ray or prescribing medication, laborious; it is, despite the electronic format,
            often very difficult to get the right information at the right time; charting can be laborious; and
            the constant need to click boxes and menu choices often means little eye contact and full-
            attention listening to patients.</p>

        <h2>So What</h2>

        <p>Research also shows that physician burnout and job dissatisfaction leads to lower quality
            care, including increased likelihood of medical errors. It is obviously to everyone’s advantage
            to make changes to our healthcare system to make the work physicians do as easy,
            accurate, efficient, and enjoyable as possible. Happier doctors are better doctors, and yet to
            date, EHR design has not responded to these needs, in part because of what has been
            called a “culture of silence” among physicians, who do not sufficiently express concerns and
            advocate for change.</p>


        <h2>Now What</h2>

        <p>The core idea for Mpathy EHR is that with extensive support for natural language
            processing and other modern features of Artificial Intelligence (AI), clinicians will be able to
            work they way they think, with minimal need to master a complex user interface, spend a lot
            of time hunting down information they need, or entering information they need to enter.
            Incredible ease of use and support for analysis and decision making will not only greatly
            improve job satisfaction but will improve efficiency, quality, and reduce medical errors and
            redundant effort. This will reduce costs, improve care, and reduce legal exposure to
            healthcare organizations.</p>

        <p>One of the most important features of the system will be a modern, natural language ability
            to search the organization’s clinical records, chart visits, and order tests and referrals, and
            perform simple reporting and data analysis. Either through voice commands or clicking an
            always-available search icon, clinicians and staff will be able to construct searches for
            whatever they might need to see, “CBC results for the past six months, abnormal values
            only”, or “all imaging results for current patient for their knee pain.” The software will
            leverage existing open-source natural language processing and AI technologies to
            implement this feature. This will make it far easier for clinicians to find specific information as
            well as to be able, on the fly, to analyze patient data to help them find patterns and make
            more informed decisions.</p>

        <p>Every patient’s life is a story, not just a collection of data points, and Mpathy will help
            clinicians see the story in its full context. With existing systems, it is not easy to reconstruct
            communications amongst staff and between staff and patients about any given concern a
            patient might call and/or be seen about. This leads to extra work, redundancy, and mistakes.
            Mpathy will make it easier to track ongoing patient issues with a feature called “issue
            threads.” In this system, issues may be tagged and, through a visual card-style interface, all
            related visits and communications will be able to be viewed. A visit or phone call, for
            example, may be inspected and it will be easy to associate related data such as lab results,
            imaging results, medication changes, or other relevant information.</p>

        <p>visits will be supported, as mentioned above, with AI technology. Subjective
            information will be able to be dictated or free-typed, and the system will recognize keywords
            and code them as symptoms. Likewise for objective findings. AI will predict possible
            diagnoses which of course can easily be disregarded by the clinician, and the plan will also
            be AI-assisted by listing common tests and treatments for the specified diagnoses.
            A key aspect of medical practice is, of course, medication management, and medication
            errors are among the most common sources of medical errors. Mpathy will improve safety
            and efficiency by providing features to help physicians organize and manage patient
            medications. For example, there is flexible medication view, which can be a list, a
            categorized list or a categorized card list. The categories will be by functional class--
            cardiovascular meds, endocrine meds, psychiatric meds, et cetera. Red lines will be drawn
            between meds that have known interactions and clicking on the lines will bring up
            information on the interaction, such as the type and severity. Clicking on any med will also
            bring up comprehensive information about the medication as well as the prescribing history
            for that patient. FDA advisories and warnings will be pushed to the clinicians’ inboxes on a
            daily basis and medications affected by such issuances will be highlighted in each patient’s
            medication list. The warning highlights can of course be dismissed.</p>

        <p>Other features will allow clinicians to schedule future follow up reminders either for routine
            screening or monitoring of a chronic or emerging problem whether it be labs, imaging, or
            other tests. Also, guidelines for all diagnoses and age- and gender-related screening will be
            easily accessible through the problem list, the search facility, or the patient summary page,
            and warnings will be able to be issued when the care plan is outside those guidelines.
            Referral status can be easily called up and progress notes from specialists and hospitals can
            be associated with the referral. Ideally, if chart notes are still faxed, OCR and AI can be used
            to extract information from those notes in a digitally-usable form.</p>

        <p>This is not a comprehensive list of features but is meant only to illustrate key features and
            concepts that will help clinicians work naturally and efficiently, and with confidence that they
            can get the information they need when they need it.</p>
